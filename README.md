# Data Structures Sorting Final

The purpose of this final is to sort randomly generated arrays with various sorting algorithms.

## Add to Machine

Open VS code in the directory you would like to add this folder to and type:

git clone https://github.com/scook5570/DataStructuresFinal.git

## Outputs

Running Sort.java will produce a CSV with sorting times for each sorting algorithm type. Three arrays will be produced for each different testing size:

1. Integers
2. Doubles
3. Strings

The arrays will be in the following sizes:

1. 10
2. 100
3. 1000
4. 10000
5. 50000
6. 100000
7. 500000

Each array will be passed through twice in sorted and unsorted forms.

Total time will be recorded for each test. This process will run three times. A spreadsheet will created from the .txt file and the data will be placed into a graph that represents the following:

* X-Axis: Sorting technique
* Y-Axis: Total time
* Line Coloration: Size of the array
