# Data Structures Sorting Final

The purpose of this final is to sort randomly generated arrays with various sorting algorithms.

## Outputs

Running Sort.java will produce a CSV with sorting times for each sorting algorithm type. Three arrays will be produced for each different testing size:

1. Integers
2. Doubles
3. Strings

The arrays will be in the following sizes:

1. 10
2. 100
3. 1000
4. 10000
5. 50000
6. 100000
7. 500000

Each array will be passed through twice in sorted and unsorted forms.

Total time will be recorded for each test.

<- Note -> Ask Prof. if she wants three tests done for each type ie: three size 10 random integer arrays
